# Swap List Nodes in Pairs

## Problem

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

## Logic

Just simulating the approach of swapping adjacent nodes. Care needs to be taken when swapping the first two nodes as the head of the linked list gets altered. Except for the first pair it is a straight-forward implementation.

## Important Points

- Linked List
