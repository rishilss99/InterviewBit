# Spiral Order Matrix II

## Problem

Given an integer A, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to A2 in spiral order.

## Logic

This is a array simulation problem and is similar to the previously encountered spiral order matrix problem. To solve this problem all we need to do is keep track of the minimum row and column along with the maximum row and column. We need to use a direction variable to control the direction in which we append elements to the array. As we iterate along the directions of the array we keep appending elements and incrementing them by 1.

## Important Points

- Array
