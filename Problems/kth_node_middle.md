# Kth Node from Middle

## Problem

Given a linked list A of length N and an integer B.

You need to find the value of the Bth node from the middle towards the beginning of the Linked List A.

If no such element exists, then return -1.

NOTE:

Position of middle node is: (N/2)+1, where N is the total number of nodes in the list.

## Logic

Once you find the length of the list, the problem is nothing more than using an empirical formula to find the required node. 

## Important Points
