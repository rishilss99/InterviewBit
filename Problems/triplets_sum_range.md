# Triplets with Sum between given range

## Problem

Given an array of real numbers greater than zero in form of strings.
Find if there exists a triplet (a,b,c) such that 1 < a+b+c < 2 .
Return 1 for true or 0 for false.

## Logic

Solved the problem with not the best logic and help from the hints. We break down the problem into 5 possible cases where the triplet condition holds true. We figure out 3 possible buckets for the elements, so that we can devise conditions that hold true for corresponding cases.

## Important Points
