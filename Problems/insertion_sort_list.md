# Insertion Sort List

## Problem

Sort a linked list using insertion sort.

## Logic

Kind of cool using sorting algorithms for linked lists. Well as the insertion sort algorithm goes you divide the list into sorted and unsorted parts and then insert elements as they fit into the sorted part from the unsorted part. What we do is get a new auxiliary head node and then insert elements from the unsorted list into this new sorted list. The thing about linked lists is that you are not actually using any new space as it is simply redirecting the addresses of the nodes.
