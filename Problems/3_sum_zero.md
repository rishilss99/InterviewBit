# 3 Sum Zero

## Problem

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0?
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

## Logic

Using the 3 sum approach is obvious. Take a pointer that iterates over the array and then two other pointers to keep track of the other 2 values. The additional conditions are used to ensure that values are not repeated in the vector.

## Important Points

- Two Pointers
