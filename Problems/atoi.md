# Atoi

## Problem

Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

## Logic

The problem is based on simple logic wherein you keep accumulating digits in the result variable and then return the final answer. An important consideration is that of -ve integers for which we use a boolean variable to return the negative sign accordingly. Also integer overflow needs to be seriously considered for which we use conditional statements at each iteration of a character in the string.
