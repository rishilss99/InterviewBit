# Add One to Number

## Problem

Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,

add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

## Logic

Seems a straight forward question at first glance but this problem really is concerned with how well do you consider the corner or the non-obvious cases. The conditions in case of carrying and ignoring zeroes preceeding the significant number need to be really checked using conditional statements. Reversing the array just makes the problem a whole lot easier to deal with. Since, our solution closely matches the editorial solution this was solved quite nicely.
