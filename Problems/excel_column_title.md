# Excel Column Title

## Problem

Given a positive integer A, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.

## Logic

This problem is just like base conversion. There is only a tiny detail to be considered i.e., while we normally start from 0 to N-1 in N base conversion in this case we go from 1 to 26 for 26 Base conversion. Hence, we need to subtract 1 or include special conditions to ensure the correct base conversion.

## Important Points
