# Search for a Range

## Problem

Given a sorted array of integers A(0 based index) of size N, find the starting and ending position of a given integar B in array A.

Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].

## Logic

Classical application of binary search to find the occurences of an element. The only difference is that in this case instead of finding the occurences of an element we just return the indices where they are found.

## Important Points

- Binary Search

- Counting occurences
