# Add Two Numbers as Lists

## Problem

You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

## Logic

Done it with strings, array, bits and now linked lists. Adding numbers never gets old. Where since they already took the pain of the reversing the list this is not particularly a tough question. The solution looks kind of big because of the corner cases i.e., when or the other list runs out. Otherwise it is straight-forward addition and carry. One important corner case is that of (99+1). This is the only case where a new node needs to be appended.

## Important Points

- Linked List
