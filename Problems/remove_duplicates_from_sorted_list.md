# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

## Problem

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

## Logic

Just like arrays, the two pointer approach is the suitable solution. Keep a pointer i that keeps check of current element and a pointer j that scans through the list. Update i to unique numbers as j finds them.

## Important Points

- Linked List

- Two Pointer
